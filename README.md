# Connect4

My partner and I developed this game as a final project for the “Introduction to Computer Science” course in order to exhibit and showcase our understanding of the various learnt concepts.

We created the game in Processing 2, using the Python mode. 

In this version of Connect4, my partner and I added a timer feature that gives each player a total of 3 minutes to make his/her moves.

This repository comprises all the relevant files of our project.
